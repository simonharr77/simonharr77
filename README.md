This is generative art piece that changes every time you experiance it. Firstly when refreshing the page a new ellipse will generate in a random place and going in a random direction. If you move you mouse around the screen it will change the colour of the ellipse, the colours have a random opacity to a certain dagree. The third way that this piece is different every time is every time you click you generate another ellipse going in a random direction that will also change colour along with the first one; these colours will mix and create new colour pallets. You can click multiple times creating more and more ellipses heading in different directions this will never be the same.
This piece was designed to random and colourful yet be eratic and chaotic. It takes insperation from Kandinskyâ€™s circles in a circle with its blend in colours, ellipses and lines.
